        RAG is a cutting-edge technique that combines the best of both worlds: information retrieval and generative AI.

    st.markdown("""
        In a world where data is abundant, finding the right information at the right time is a challenge. 
        Traditional search engines can retrieve documents, but they don‚Äôt generate insights or synthesize information. 
        Generative AI models like GPT can create responses, but they lack factual grounding. 
        **RAG bridges this gap** by combining retrieval with generation, providing factually accurate and context-aware outputs.

        **1Ô∏è‚É£ Retrieve**  
        A search module retrieves relevant documents from a knowledge base or vector database.  
        Techniques like vector embeddings and semantic search are used for accurate retrieval.

        **2Ô∏è‚É£ Generate**  
        A generative AI model (like GPT) takes the query and retrieved documents as input.  
        The model generates a coherent response grounded in the retrieved data.

        The system refines responses iteratively by incorporating user feedback or additional queries.
